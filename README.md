# Instructions

## TASK 1
* Create a normalized Database Schema for the following Dataset for [Software Companies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16uXnRa3jRmT5KK4tQCkCabE9j3nKsLKX/edit?usp%3Dsharing%26ouid%3D116630687391172440524%26rtpof%3Dtrue%26sd%3Dtrue&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1731105129609306&usg=AOvVaw2-sVHhDwuflGtqFMaBmUQ0)

- Read (GET)
- Update (PUT)
- Delete(DELETE)
## Task 4 -  Create a Script to Fetch Data for Prediction
* Fetch Data of the latest Entry:
* Write a script to fetch data using the API.
* Prepare Data for Prediction:
* Load the model you created. (You can choose a model one of you used in Intro to ML)
* Prepare input data and use the model to make predictions.
